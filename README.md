# Phenylâœ¨
`Phenyl` provides an out-of-the-box bridge between chat apps and Minecraft.

Currently works for [Bungeecord](https://github.com/SpigotMC/BungeeCord)(and its compatible forks,
e.g. [Waterfall](https://github.com/PaperMC/Waterfall)) and [Tencent QQ](https://im.qq.com/index).

## Setup

Drop the jar file into your `plugins` folder and modify the `config.yml` in `Phenyl` directory. That's all.

Notice: `Phenyl` requires JRE 17 or higher to run. If you're still using an old version, consider updating it.

## Build

To compile `Phenyl` from source, make sure you're using JDK17 and run:

```bash
./gradlew jar
```

The generated jar file should be found in the project root's `build/libs` directory.

## Contribute

`Phenyl` is an open source project, feel free to open pull requests.
